We provide tools to aid Mathematicians that help them to solve problems collaboratively and share their discoveries with everyone.\n\nThe interface crystallizes Profs. Timothy Gowers and Terry Tao's vision for large scale online collaborations. We have implemented all features they wished for (see <a href='https://terrytao.wordpress.com/2009/07/22/imo-2009-q6-mini-polymath-project-impressions-reflections-analysis#comment-40659' target=\"_blank\">this</a> and <a href='https://gowers.wordpress.com/2009/03/24/can-polymath-be-scaled-up' target=\"_blank\">this</a>) and more. Here are a few highlights:\n\n1. Hierarchical arrangement of Wiki-like pages for  <a href='https://gowers.wordpress.com/2009/03/24/can-polymath-be-scaled-up' target=\"_blank\">\"Proof-discovery tree\"</a>.\n1. Visualization of proofs (including partial/in-progress)\n1. Structured data organization (definitions, theorems, arguments)\n1. $\\LaTeX$ support\n1. Group moderation\n1. Comment auto-numbering, preview, editing\n\nWe show how the polymath 14 project, initiated by Prof. Terry Tao on <a href=\"https://terrytao.wordpress.com/2017/12/16/bi-invariant-metrics-of-linear-growth-on-the-free-group/\" target=\"_blank\">his blog</a>, would benefit from Sophize's collaboration tools.

We extract definitions, theorems, proofs, references, and keywords from this <a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.03908' target='_blank'>paper</a>. This information gets added to Sophize pool of knowledge and provides a more productive environment for the reader to grasp the information contained in the literature.
