  "argumentText": "The function $\\ell'(x) := \\ell(x) + k$ is a semi-length unction. Further, $\\ell'$ satisfies the homogeneity condition with $c$ replaced by $c' := k+c$, whenever $\\ell$ satisfies homogeneity condition on the nose. Thus #P_main_p2.1 continues to hold if the triangle inequality is replaced by the condition $\\ell(xy) \\leq \\ell(x) + \\ell(y) + k$ for all $x, y\\in G$, with the bound in the conclusion becoming $5c + 4k$."
