  "argumentText": "Suppose that $G$ is a group with a #T_hplf ${\\ell}: G \\to [0,+\\infty)$. Applying #P_main_p2.1 with $c=0$, we conclude that ${\\ell({[x,y]})}=0$ for all $x,y \\in G$, thus by the triangle inequality ${\\ell}$ vanishes on the commutator subgroup $[G,G]$, and therefore factors through the abelianization $G_{\\mathrm{ab}} \\coloneqq G/[G,G]$ of $G$.  Factoring out by $[G,G]$ like this, we may now assume without loss of generality that $G$ is abelian. To reflect this, we now use additive notation for $G$, thus for instance ${\\ell({nx})} = |n| {\\ell({x})}$ for each $x \\in G$ and $n \\in {\\mathbb{Z}}$, and one can also view $G$ as a module over the integers ${\\mathbb{Z}}$. \n\nAt this point we repeat the arguments by #(R.Ro4, 'Khare & Rajaratnam') (#(.global/P.lqm, 'transfer principle')), which treated the case when $G$ was separable, though it turns out that this separability hypothesis is unnecessary. \n\nIf $x$ is a torsion element of $G$, i.e. $nx=0$ for some $n$, then the homogeneity condition forces ${\\ell({x})}=0$. Thus ${\\ell}$ vanishes on the torsion subgroup of $G$; factoring out by this subgroup, we may thus assume without loss of generality that $G$ is not only abelian, but is also torsion-free.\n\nWe can view $G$ as a subgroup of the ${\\mathbb{Q}}$-vector space $G \\otimes_{\\mathbb{Z}}{\\mathbb{Q}}$, the elements of which can be formally expressed as $\\frac{1}{n} x$ for natural numbers $n$ and elements $x \\in G$ (with two such expressions $\\frac{1}{n} x, \\frac{1}{m} y$ identified if and only if $mx = ny$, and the ${\\mathbb{Q}}$-vector space operations defined in the obvious fashion); the fact that this is well defined as a ${\\mathbb{Q}}$-vector space follows from the hypotheses that $G$ is abelian and torsion-free. We can then define the map $\\| \\, \\|_{\\mathbb{Q}}: G \\otimes_{\\mathbb{Z}}{\\mathbb{Q}}\\to [0,+\\infty)$ by setting\n\n$$\\left\\|\\frac{1}{n} x\\right\\|_{\\mathbb{Q}}\\coloneqq \\frac{1}{n} {\\ell({x})}$$\n\nfor any $x \\in G$ and natural number $n$; the linear growth condition ensures that $\\|\\,\\|_{\\mathbb{Q}}$ is well-defined.   It is not difficult to verify that $\\| \\, \\|_{\\mathbb{Q}}$ is indeed a seminorm over the ${\\mathbb{Q}}$-vector space $G \\otimes_{\\mathbb{Z}}{\\mathbb{Q}}$.\n\nThe norm $\\| \\, \\|_{\\mathbb{Q}}$ on $G \\otimes_{\\mathbb{Z}}{\\mathbb{Q}}$ gives a metric $d(x, y) = \\|x-y \\|_{\\mathbb{Q}}$. Consider the metric completion $\\mathbb{B}$ of $G \\otimes_{\\mathbb{Z}}{\\mathbb{Q}}$ with this metric. It is easy to see that the ${\\mathbb{Q}}$-vector space structure on $G \\otimes_{\\mathbb{Z}}{\\mathbb{Q}}$ extends to an ${\\mathbb{R}}$-vector space structure on $\\mathbb{B}$, and the norm $\\|\\,\\|_{\\mathbb{Q}}$ on $G \\otimes_{\\mathbb{Z}}{\\mathbb{Q}}$ extends to a norm $\\|\\,\\|_{\\mathbb{R}}$ on $\\mathbb{B}$. As $\\mathbb{B}$ is complete by construction, it is a Banach space. The inclusion of $G$ in $G \\otimes_{\\mathbb{Z}}{\\mathbb{Q}}$ gives a homomorphism $\\phi: G \\to \\mathbb{B}$ as required. ",
