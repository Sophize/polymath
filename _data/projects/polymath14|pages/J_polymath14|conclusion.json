The paper completely classifies <em>homogeneous length functions</em> ${\\| \\|: G \\rightarrow {\\bf R}^+}$  on an arbitrary group  ${G = (G,\\cdot,e,()^{-1})}$ , that is to say non-negative functions that obey the symmetry condition  ${\\|x^{-1}\\| = \\|x\\|}$ , the non-degeneracy condition  ${\\|x\\|=0 \\iff x=e}$ , the triangle inequality  ${\\|xy\\| \\leq \\|x\\| + \\|y\\|}$ , and the homogeneity condition  ${\\|x^2\\| = 2\\|x\\|}$ . It turns out that these norms can only arise from pulling back the norm of a Banach space by an isometric embedding of the group. Among other things, this shows that  ${G}$  can only support a homogeneous length function if and only if it is abelian and torsion free, thus giving a metric description of this property. \n\n The proof is based on repeated use of the homogeneous length function axioms, combined with elementary identities of commutators, to obtain increasingly good bounds on quantities such as  ${\\|[x,y]\\|}$ , until one can show that such norms have to vanish. See <a href=\"https://terrytao.wordpress.com/2017/12/21/metrics-of-linear-growth-the-solution/\">the previous post</a> for a full proof. The result is robust in that it allows for some loss in the triangle inequality and homogeneity condition, allowing for some new results on \"quasinorms\" on groups that relate to quasihomomorphisms.\n"
